Incoming <a href=""https://www.abf.gov.au/entering-and-leaving-australia/crossing-the-border/at-the-border/incoming-passenger-card-(ipc)"">Passenger Cards</a> are distributed during your flight to Australia by your airline. For more information about visas, see â€œcheck your passport and travel documentsâ€ section below.<br>
COVID-19 requirements: Travellers do not require a pre-departure COVID-19 test to enter or transit Australia regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status. You should check if COVID-19 testing requirements are different for any transit countries you will pass through on the way to Australia, or if your airline has additional requirements. <br>
As of 6 July 2022, travellers to Australia will no longer have to complete a Digital Passenger Declaration if arriving by air, or a Maritime Travel Declaration if arriving by sea, and there is no requirement to declare or prove your vaccination status for entry to Australia. <br>
However, states and territories can apply their own travel restrictions on travellers arriving from international and domestic locations. You should <a href=""https://www.australia.gov.au/states"">check requirements for the state or territory/< a> in which you will arrive. Border rules can change quickly. Travellers should prepare for disruptions to their plans. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19/domestic-travel#state-and-territory-travel-restrictions"">check requirements for the state or territory</a> in which you will arrive. If any quarantine requirements apply, for example if you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to comply with the quarantine requirements in the state or territory you are in before travelling on to another state or territory. <br>
*If youâ€™re fully vaccinated: All fully vaccinated visa holders can travel to Australia.<br>
Proof of vaccination status: From 6 July 2022, proof of vaccination is not required for entry into Australia. You may be required to provide proof of vaccination status to enter or transit through other countries, or for use within Australia. If you were vaccinated in Australia, you should use an<a href=""https://www.passports.gov.au/international-covid-19-vaccination-certificate"">International COVID-19 Vaccine Certificate</a>  (ICVC) generated by Services Australia. <br>
Australia will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record and proof of COVID-19. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
*If youâ€™re not fully vaccinated: From 6 July 2022, proof of vaccination is no longer required for entry into Australia. All visa holders can travel to Australia, regardless of vaccination status. You should check if proof of COVID-19 vaccination status requirements are different for any transit countries you will pass through on the way to Australia, or if your airline has additional requirements. <br>
Each state and territory is responsible for determining and managing quarantine requirements. You should <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/health-alerts/covid-19/domestic-travel#state-and-territory-travel-restrictions"">check requirements for the state or territory</a> in which you will arrive. <br>
If any quarantine requirements apply, for example if you test positive for COVID-19, you will need to comply with the quarantine requirements in the state or territory you are in before travelling on to another state or territory. <br>
Public health restrictions may apply differently to people who are not vaccinated for COVID-19. Proof of COVID-19 vaccination may be required for entering certain places or premises. You should check requirements for all the states and territories you plan to visit. <br>
*Children and young people: From 6 July 2022, children and young people will not be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination status to enter Australia.

*If youâ€™re transiting through Australia: As of 6 July 2022, travellers transiting through Australia will no longer have to complete a Digital Passenger Declaration if arriving by air, or a Maritime Travel Declaration if arriving by sea. <br>
British citizens are eligible to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. If you wish to transit without a visa, you must remain airside and you will not be able to clear immigration, including to collect baggage which should have been checked through to your final destination. You can check information from the Department of Home Affairs on  <a href=""https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/transit-771/travellers-eligible-to-transit-without-visa"">transiting without a visa</a>. If you are not eligible to transit without a visa, for example if your transit time is longer than 8 hours, you will need to apply for and obtain a visa before travelling to Australia. <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on September 13.2022, there are no longer any requirements for travellers to be fully vaccinated in order to travel to New Zealand. However, some transport providers might have in place certain requirements for passengers to travel with them, so please consult your travel providerâ€™s website for further information. <br>
Eligible travellers entering New Zealand will also be given a pack of rapid antigen tests (RATs) with <a href=""https://covid19.govt.nz/international-travel/travel-to-new-zealand/testing-requirements-after-arriving-in-new-zealand/"">instructions </a> for use, at the airport. The requirement to test on day 0/1 and 5/6 now encouraged rather than required. Please see  <a href=""https://covid19.govt.nz/international-travel/travel-to-new-zealand/when-new-zealand-borders-open/#self-isolation-requirements""> New Zealand Government COVID-19</a> for full details. <br>
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. <br>
The NZeTA costs NZD $9 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $12 if completed online. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing. <br>
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website. New Zealandâ€™s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand. <br>

*If youâ€™re transiting through New Zealand: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
If you are planning to transit through New Zealand to another country you must request a NZeTA before you travel. You must ensure you hold the necessary entry documentation to your final destination and the other countries which you will transit through. <br>
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for online. See <a href=""https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta"">Information about NZeTA  </a> for further detail.<br>

However, before you travel domestically within New Zealand, make sure you check the COVID-19 requirements with your transport provider as each company may have different policies. <br>
The New Zealand Government does not currently require people to keep track of their movements to help with contact tracing. However, the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer app is still available to download for this purpose with many shops and businesses displaying their QR codes for scanning. You can find out more about scanning and contact tracing <a href=https://covid19.govt.nz/testing-and-tracing/"""">here</a>.
Range of measures that can be applied locally or nationally: COVID-19 public health measures and restrictions may be applied at a town, city, territorial local authority, regional or national level. <br>

International Restrictions:  <br>
*All travellers: You will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver to enter or transit the USA as a visitor. You should consult theâ€¯<a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website</a> to determine which you will need.<br>
You should be aware that if you have travelled to or have been in Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen on or after 1 March 2011, you are normally not eligible for an ESTA visa waiver and will need to apply for a US visa.<br>
The US Embassy advise that travellers who come under the following categories should not attempt to travel on an ESTA and should instead apply for a visa: those who have been arrested (even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction); those who have a criminal record; those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from the USA; those who have previously overstayed under an ESTA. <br>
*If youâ€™re fully vaccinated: Most fully vaccinated foreign citizens can enter the USA. The US authorities will accept any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These are the AstraZeneca, BIBP/Sinopharm, Covishield, Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. In addition, those who have received the full series of an active (not placebo) COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trials are considered vaccinated. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. Foreign nationals planning to travel to the USA should familiarise themselves with the new requirements on the CDC website before booking any travel.<br>
All current visa holders based in the USA who leave the country and then re-enter will need to follow the vaccine entry requirements unless they have an exception. This includes students on F-1 and M-1 visas and those previously issued with an existing National Interest Exception. <br>
All air passengers to the USA are also required to provide contact information to their airlines before boarding. You should check with your airline before you travel for more details. Effective from Sunday 12 June 2022 at 00:01 ET (5:01 am BST), the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">CDC</a> no longer require pre-departure COVID-19 testing for USA-bound air travellers. <br>

If you have recovered from a documented COVID-19 infection within the past 90 days (regardless of vaccination status):<br>
â€¢        you do not need to get a test 3 to 5 days after travel<br>

You should check the list frequently as it is likely to change, sometimes daily, as rates of COVID-19 transmission increase or decrease.<br>
*Proof of vaccination status: The USA will accept <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/guidance/demonstrating-your-covid-19-status"">proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record</a>. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. <br>
The <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html"">CDC website</a> lists the forms of acceptable proof of COVID-19 status. This also includes the European Union Digital COVID Certificate. Other accepted methods of proof include a printout of a COVID-19 vaccination record or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued at national or subnational level or by an authorized vaccine provider. Alternatively, digital photos of a vaccination card or record, a downloaded vaccine record or a vaccination certificate from an official source (e.g. public health agency, government agency, or other authorised vaccine provider), or a mobile phone application without a QR code. All forms of COVID-19 status must have a personal identifier, at a minimum including full name and date of birth, that match the information on a passengerâ€™s passport or other travel documents. It must also include the name of the official source issuing the record and the vaccine manufacturer and date(s) of vaccination.<br>

*If youâ€™ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If youâ€™re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year you still cannot enter the USA unless you meet one of the exceptions detailed on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>.<br>
*Children and young people: Children 17 and under are exempt from the vaccination requirement. For travel, the US definition of a fully vaccinated child is the same as the definition of a fully vaccinated adult. <br>
After arrival in the US, children 17 and under that are not fully vaccinated may be required to attest that they will take a test 3 to 5 days and will self-isolate should any symptoms develop or if they test positive. A parent or other authorized person should attest on behalf of a passenger 17 and under.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
A number of US states no longer mandate the use of masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">USA.GOV  </a> site. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. Some private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, have made proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
*Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children aged 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
*If you test positive while in the USA, you may be required to isolate in a private area, likely a hotel or a private residence. Isolation requirements will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing/visiting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">recommends</a> a minimum isolation period of at least five full days. Any assistance for those required to quarantine will depend on the local authority. The CDC has <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">updated guidance  </a> with recommendations for what to do if you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. You should check the CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"">travel planner</a> to verify local state guidance.
