International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Afghanistan: The authorities in Afghanistan set and enforce entry rules. For further information contact the embassy or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to. You should also consider checking with your transport or travel provider to make sure your passport and other travel documents meet their requirements. <br>
You should also check specific COVID-19 test requirements airlines and transit countries have in place in advance of your flight. Airlines may refuse boarding if their requirements are not met. <br>

*Travel in Afghanistan: Healthcare in Afghanistan is very limited. Medical facilities, including those in Kabul, do not have the capacity or capability to effectively deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The supply of ICU beds and ventilators is low. There are areas which have no medical facilities with ICU beds and ventilators.<br>
There is no guarantee that any local health care will be available in the current security situation. Whilst an estimated 30 per cent of the population had been exposed to COVID-19 by June 2020, WHO warns that widespread complacency and failure to follow public health advice is creating grave risks in the community with people generally not observing physical distancing or mask-wearing protocols.

<br>
International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: You will need the following to enter Bangladesh: <br>
•        a visa (see below for information on visas). <br>
an online <a href=""https://healthdeclaration.dghs.gov.bd/"">Health Declaration form</a>. The form needs to be completed within three days of departure. You will need to present a copy of the submitted form when you check in with your airline and/or when you arrive in Bangladesh <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated you can enter Bangladesh without needing to quarantine, provided your vaccination course was completed no less than 14 days prior to arrival. <br>
A pre-departure negative RT-PCR test result for COVID-19 is no longer required in such circumstances. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: Bangladesh will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Arriving passengers who are unable to provide proof of vaccination, or proof that their vaccination course was completed at least 14 days prior to arrival, are required to present evidence of a negative RT PCR based COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours prior to departure for Bangladesh. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
All passengers, regardless of vaccination status, may be subjected to additional health screening measures on arrival. Passengers with COVID-19 symptoms will be required to take a PCR test. Those testing positive will be required to isolate at a government authorised facility for at least seven days and until they test negative in a subsequent PCR test. <br>
In all circumstances, people staying in a government approved hotel, government facility or hospital will need to cover the costs of those stays and any necessary COVID-19 tests. The Bangladesh authorities may retain passports of any passengers in quarantine and will re-turn them at the end of the quarantine period. <br>
Passengers with a No Visa Required certificate (an arrangement for foreign nationals of Bangladeshi heritage) arriving in Bangladesh without a medical certificate indicating they are COVID-19 negative, or such passengers who display symptoms, will be transferred to a government facility where their quarantine period will be assessed and determined. <br>
*Exemptions: Exemptions to quarantine arrangements are issued on an exceptional and case by case basis. Travellers should contact the Bangladesh High Commission or Bangladesh authorities in advance of travel to discuss any possible exemptions. <br>
*Children and young people: There is no requirement for children under 12 to present a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test result. Children under 12 should follow the same regime that applies to those family members they are travelling with, regardless of their vaccination status. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Bangladesh: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
For those planning to transit through Bangladesh on your way to another country, visas for Bangladesh are not required for those remaining airside at the airport. However, we have been unable to confirm that COVID-19 measures do not apply, and we would recommend meeting the Government of Bangladesh’s COVID-19 requirements. For example, unvaccinated travellers may wish to ensure that they have a negative PCR test result, taken no more than 72 hours of their departure, and familiarise themselves with any airline requirements, together with those of the final destination. <br>
<br> <br> 
Internal Restrictions:<br>
*Moving around in Bangladesh: North-east Bangladesh, particularly Sylhet District is impacted by heavy flooding. Sylhet Airport flights are suspended and transport routes affected, consider your need to travel carefully.
Public transport in other districts, including domestic flights, is operating. However COVID-19 related travel restrictions may come into force at short notice and you should check local guidance and media reports for the latest developments. <br>
Face masks must be worn at all times when moving in and around Bangladesh. Anyone not complying with these requests risks legal action. <br>
*Businesses and services: Businesses, including shops, offices and banking services, have largely resumed operatio;ns with minimal restrictions. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels and guesthouses are operating. Check with your travel or accommodation provider for available options. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

  <a href=""https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Alerts%2CTravel%20Advisories"">OSAC Travel Advisories</a>/","Latest News:  Authorities lift COVID-19 test requirement for fully vaccinated travelers from 25 May (Travel Weekly, 25.05.2022)
<br>
<br>
International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Entry to Barbados: Barbados has published travel protocols setting out its entry requirements in relation to COVID-19. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Visit Barbados website</a> for full details. You should read these before your departure and monitor the pages on a regular basis as the requirements may change at short notice. Masks should be worn at all times during your travel to Barbados and your passage through the airport. Social distancing and hygiene protocols are in place. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Fully vaccinated people (2 doses administered more than 14 days prior to arrival or single dose where only one dose administered) are not required to complete a pre-arrival COVID-19 test and will not be subject to testing or quarantine on arrival. Once you have completed a health check and your documentation (proof of vaccination status) has been validated, you will be free to move around Barbados unhindered. <br>
A number of fully vaccinated arrivals will be randomly chosen to have a rapid antigen test. There is no requirement to quarantine, as the result will be made available very quickly. See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for further details. <br>
Details of what the Barbadian authorities will accept as proof of vaccination can be found in the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>. If you are unable to provide sufficient proof that you have been vaccinated then you will be treated as if you are unvaccinated.
*Proof of vaccination status: Barbados will accept the  proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your final vaccine dose must have been administered at least 14 days prior to travel. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Unvaccinated travellers must present on arrival either: <br>
•        a valid RT-PCR COVID-19 negative test result taken no more than 3 days in advance of your flight’s arrival. The test can be taken at any time during the day 3 days prior to the date of your arrival in Barbados. (For example, if your flight arrives at 10pm on Saturday, you can take a test at any time on the Wednesday prior to this) <br>
•        a valid Rapid PCR COVID-19 negative test result taken one day before arrival in Barbados <br>
•        a valid Rapid Antigen negative test result taken one day before arrival in Barbados <br>
Accepted tests include tests which were taken at an approved or recognised laboratory by a healthcare provider via a nasopharyngeal sample, oropharyngeal sample, nasal sample, anterior nares samples or mid-turbinate sample. Your test certificate should provide this information. LAMP tests, shallow nasal swab samples, self-administered tests or home kits or tests using saliva samples will not be accepted. Relevant test accrediting bodies and standards authorities include: ISO 15189, CAP, UKAS or the equivalent. You should check the protocols to confirm and understand all requirements. All passengers are also required to submit an Embarkation/Disembarkation (ED) card 24 hours prior to travel, to which they should upload their negative test result via <a href=""https://www.travelform.gov.bb/home"">Travel Form</a>. The BIMSafe app can also be used. <br>
If you arrive in Barbados without a valid negative COVID test, you may be denied entry to the country. You should not use the testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. On arrival all passengers are also subject to a health screen. <br>
If you have recovered from recently diagnosed COVID-19 and your pre-flight PCR test is still positive, you should bring a letter from your medical practitioner with lab test results showing the date of diagnosis and recovery. You may be obliged on arrival to complete an assessment at one of the government isolation facilities for up to 48 hours before being released from quarantine. <br>
From 20 August, unvaccinated arrivals are no longer required to quarantine or to take a test on arrival: once you have completed a health check and your documentation (pre-arrival test) has been validated, you will be free to move around Barbados unhindered. <br>
See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2021"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for full details.
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recovered from recently diagnosed COVID-19 and your pre-flight PCR test is still positive, you should bring a letter from your medical practitioner with lab test results showing the date of diagnosis and recovery.

*Children and young people: Children aged 17 and under who are travelling with a fully vaccinated adult can follow the rules for the fully vaccinated adult to enter Barbados. <br>
Children aged 17 and under who are travelling unaccompanied must show proof of a valid test result, in line with the requirements set out on this page and in the  <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2021"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>.
*If you’re transiting through Barbados: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
See the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2021"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a> for full details of requirements for both vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers transiting through Barbados. <br>
*Exemptions: Travellers with circumstances they believe warrant an exemption to any of the entry requirements to Barbados are advised to contact the Ministry of Health and Wellness in Barbados to have their requests considered. Requests for exemptions should be sent to <a href=""covid19hotline@barbados.gov.bb"">covid19hotline@barbados.gov.bb</a> at least 3 days prior to arrival.

The Government’s COVID-19 protocols may be subject to change at short notice and you should therefore review these regularly. <br>
All persons arriving in Barbados are required to wear face masks at all times whilst on airport grounds. Persons may also have their temperature taken. In moving around Barbados, follow social distancing protocols. <br>
Masks are mandatory in all indoor public spaces and on public transport. You can expect to have your temperature taken and you may be asked to supply your contact details when entering some premises. Regular washing of hands is encouraged and you can expect to be asked to clean your hands using hand sanitizer on entering a building. <br>
You may be required to quarantine and/or undergo a further COVID-19 test at any stage of your stay if the Barbados authorities deem that you have been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive individual or mandatory monitoring highlights potential COVID-19 symptoms. <br>
The Barbadian authorities will seek to prosecute people who breach COVID-19 protocols, including those who break quarantine protocols, which may result in a fine and/or prison sentence. <br>
You may require a pre-departure test. Information about the pre-departure tests which Barbados provides can be found in the <a href=""https://www.visitbarbados.org/covid-19-travel-guidelines-2020"">Barbados Travel Protocols</a>. 
*If you test positive for COVID-19 and are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, you will be required to self-isolate at your own expense for 7 days. Strict rules are in place for this self-isolation. Visitors will not be able to leave the island until the 7 days’ self-isolation is complete and a discharge email has been received. Visitors should ensure they have sufficient travel and medical insurance to cover additional costs in this eventuality. <br>

Internations Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry to Cameroon: There are multiple commercial flight options to enter and leave Cameroon.  Access across Cameroon’s land and sea borders is currently restricted due to COVID-19.<br>
Travel requirements to enter and exit Cameroon can change without notice and without proactive communication. The Centre for the Coordination of Public Health Emergency Operations conditions of entry and exit to Cameroon <a href=""https://www.ccousp.cm/urgences-sanitaires/Fcovid-19/condition-dentree-et-sortie-au-cameroun/"">website</a> is the best source of the latest information.
You must have proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before first boarding) negative coronavirus PCR test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. <br>
The Government of Cameroon demands a negative Coronavirus PCR test from all travellers aged five and above. (Some airlines demand a PCR test from travellers aged two and above, so check with your airline.) <br>
Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test. Electronic copies are accepted. <br>
You should not use the testing service to get a test in order to facilitate your travel to another country. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
Testing/screening on arrival: In addition to the requirement to have a negative PCR test 72 hours before embarkation for Cameroon, all international travellers are subjected to extra rapid flow testing for Coronavirus on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. <br>
Quarantine requirements: If you have a proof of a recent (no older than 72 hours before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate. Anyone that has developed symptoms of Coronavirus on their travel or tests positive on arrival at Yaoundé or Douala airport will be held for further enquiries to trace contacts and movements. We believe that anyone testing positive can quarantine at the location of your host or private accommodation until a negative PCR test is produced. These requirements are regularly evolving. <br>
  <br>
  <br> 
  Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *Public places and services: Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted.
The wearing of face-masks has almost entirely been dropped, including in public buildings. However, you should carry one on you in case needed. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

•        Self-isolate for 14 days (You are legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Heavy penalties apply if you fail to comply).<br>
If you do not have a valid test result, you will be denied boarding or entry. Final determination regarding entry and quarantine is made by a government representative at the port of entry based on the information presented to them at the time of entry into Canada. <br>
You must follow the handout given to you at time of entry, as well as all additional federal, provincial/territorial and local public health measures, including wearing a well-constructed mask en route to your place of quarantine. If you have symptoms or an unsuitable quarantine plan, follow the directions provided by the government representative. <br>
Dependents 18 years of age or over who are unvaccinated because of mental or physical limitation may enter but must follow all testing and quarantine requirements, even when they are accompanied by parents or guardians who qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller. <br>
Children aged 5 -11, who are accompanied by a <a href=""https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada?utm_source=digital-engagement-toolkit&utm_medium=email&utm_content=vaccinated-en&utm_campaign=phac-dek-sept-2021#determine-fully"">fully vaccinated</a> parent, step-parent, guardian or tutor, are no longer required to complete a pre-entry COVID-19 test for entry to Canada.<br>
Canadian citizens (including dual citizens), people registered under the Indian Act, permanent residents of Canada, or protected persons (refugee status) are allowed to enter Canada if not fully vaccinated. <br>
Further information about unvaccinated travellers entering Canada during COVID-19 is available on the <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/unvaccinated-travellers-entering-canada-covid-19.html"">Public Health Agency of Canada’s website</a>. For questions about travel during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/contact-us.html"""">contact Health Canada</a>`.
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, you still need at least 2 doses of an accepted COVID-19 vaccine, a mix of 2 accepted vaccines or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to enter Canada for discretionary (non-essential) purposes. <br>
If you’ve only had one dose of an accepted vaccine other than Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), you don’t qualify for the fully vaccinated traveller exemption. <br>
*Children and young people: Children aged 12 to 17 years must follow the rules for fully vaccinated travellers to enter Canada. Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children aged 12 to 17 are subject to the 14-day quarantine, and all testing requirements for pre-entry, arrival and Day-8 tests, whether or not they are accompanied by travellers who qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller. <br>
Unvaccinated asymptomatic travellers 12 years of age and over are not required to quarantine upon entering Canada if they meet have a medical contraindication against getting a COVID-19 vaccine and comply with certain measures. See <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/awareness-resources/travellers-over-12-without-symptoms-medically-exempt-vaccination.html"">Public Health Canada’s website for further information</a>.
Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged 11 and under accompanied by a partially vaccinated or unvaccinated adult must complete pre-entry, arrival and Day-8 tests, unless you have evidence that the child had a positive COVID-19 test taken 14 to 180 days prior to arrival in Canada or the child is aged 4 and under. There are additional rules that must be followed for the first 14 days of their visit, such as not attending school and limiting contact with others. Further details are available on the  <a href=""https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada#children"">Government of Canada’s travel pages</a>.
If you qualify as a fully vaccinated traveller, your unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged 11 and under will be exempt from taking a pre-departure test and quarantine, without any limitations on their activities, and are no longer required to produce a quarantine plan. This means, for example, they no longer need to wait 14 days before attending school, camp or day care. <br>
Adults travelling with fully vaccinated children between the ages of 5 to 11 have the option to upload their proof of vaccination into ArriveCAN.<br>
The benefit of uploading the child’s proof is that if they are travelling with an adult who does not qualify as fully vaccinated, the child will qualify for an exemption from quarantine and mandatory testing on Day 1 and Day 8. <br>
Further information is available on the <a href=""https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada#children"">government of Canada travel pages</a>.

•        plan your travel so you arrive and depart from the same Canadian airport within 24 hours. Domestic transfers are not permitted <br>
•        make sure your baggage is checked through to a destination outside of Canada <br>

During your connection you must remain in the secure transit area to complete your connection. This means that you will not be allowed to collect your baggage, or check-in for your next flight anywhere but at your scheduled gate of departure. <br>
You are exempt from testing and quarantine requirements, as long as you remain in the se-cure transit area to complete your connection within 24 hours.

  Internal Restrictions:<br> 
*Travel in Canada: To help curb the spread of coronavirus, provincial governments have introduced a number of measures. There are some regional variations, but they generally include:
•        limit on numbers in bars and restaurants and at large gatherings in affected cities and regions <br>
•        mandatory wearing of face masks in certain indoor public settings <br>
*Public spaces and services: Travellers aged 12 and above must be fully vaccinated to depart from Canadian airports on both domestic and international flights, or travel on VIA Rail and Rocky Mountaineer trains. There are very limited exceptions. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. The Canadian authorities recommend the use of non-medical masks/facial coverings when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, including on public transportation. Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. <br>
Federal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces. You should comply with the rules and advice of local authorities in relation to coronavirus. Check <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html"">guidance for each province</a>.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

  <br>
  <br> 
International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: All travellers should familiarise themselves with the entry rules for Chile before travel. Review the entry requirements into Chile very carefully. These change depending on the COVID ‘Alert Level’ in Chile, at the time of your entry. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1.<br>
•        A pre-departure test is recommended for all travellers arriving in Alert Level 1, but is not mandatory only in this alert level.<br>
•        At Alert Levels 2 and 3, all travellers are required to have a negative pre-departure PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not accepted), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement.<br>
Non-resident foreigners are recommended to have a valid Mobility Pass (‘Pase de movilidad’). This is only optional in the lowest alert level (Alert Level 1) but is mandatory for entry in Alert levels 2 and 3.You must validate your vaccination in order to obtain a validMobility Pass with Chilean authorities. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit <a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">‘MeVacuno website’</a>. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email address to access the site. You should allow at least 30 days for your Mobility Pass application to be processed. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass document with a QR code will be issued. Children under 6 years old who have not been able to access a vaccination program do not need to meet this requirement<br>
•        Non-resident foreigners need to hold proof of travel insurance covering a minimum of $30,000 USD for COVID-related issues for the entire duration of your stay<br>
All travellers need to <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">complete an affidavit</a> (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline when checking-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening. <br>
Upon arrival, you should follow the instructions of airport authorities regarding testing requirements. You might need to undergo an antigen or PCR test SARS-COV-2, either in the airport or at an external laboratory outside the airport. If the latter, you will need to do this within 24 hours of arrival. If you undergo an antigen test, you will need to wait for the results in the airport. If the result is positive, non-resident foreigners will be denied entry into the country. <br>
Non-resident foreign nationals with two vaccinations will be entitled to a Mobility Pass valid for 30 days and those with a booster shot will be entitled to 90 days. <br>
Please bear in mind that you will be required to show your Mobility Pass to enter many private and public places in Chile. <br>
More information about what you need to do when you enter Chile can be found <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/documentos/"">here</a>, selecting ‘Plan Fronteras Protegidas’. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: Chile will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status.<br>
The proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record will not suffice to demonstrate your vaccination status when entering Chile. You must validate your vaccination status with Chilean authorities to receive a Mobility Pass. To apply for a Mobility Pass visit <a href=""https://mevacuno.gob.cl/"">‘MeVacuno website’</a>. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email to access the site. <br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past month: If you test positive for COVID-19 a month preceding your boarding to Chile, and if 72 hours prior to boarding, you continue to test positive, you can replace the negative PCR result by showing Chilean authorities the two positive PCR test results. One of the positive PCR tests must have been taken up to 72 hours prior to boarding, the other positive PCR test must have been taken more than 10 days prior to the date of boarding but less than one month before boarding.<br>
*Children and young people: If you travel with children under 18 years old you must review the documents you will need to show upon entry on the  <a href=""https://chile.gob.cl/chile/en/xplica/ingreso-y-salida-de-menores-del-pais"">Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a>.<br>
*Children under 6 years old: All children under 6 years old (including non-resident foreigners) are allowed to enter Chile without a mobility pass carrying:
•        a negative PCR test SARS-COV-2 (rapid and antigen tests are not acceptable), taken no more than 72 hours before boarding the final flight into Santiago. Children under 2 years old do not need to meet this requirement<br>
•        <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">complete an affidavit</a> (Declaración Jurada) up to 48 hours before boarding. This will generate a QR-code document (sent by e-mail), which you must show to the airline in check-in and during the health screening process on arrival in Chile. Health authorities at Santiago Airport will request all travellers complete a daily ‘self-report’ – for 7 days – via an online form or ‘C19 AutoReporte’ application. The health authorities will provide the detail of this process by email following the health screening.<br>
*If you’re transiting through Chile: Transiting through Chile on your way to another country without exiting the airport premises and without transiting to a domestic flight is permitted. Nevertheless, if you wish to exit the airport or if your transit comprises flying to another city within Chile, Chilean authorities will require you to meet all the current entry requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Chile: The Chilean government provides coronavirus-related information on the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/"">Official COVID-19 Government website</a>. Travellers arriving in Chile should be aware that local authorities frequently move municipalities (comunas) back and forth through the government “Keep Taking Care Stages Plan” (Plan Seguimos Cuidándonos, Paso a Paso), according to the level of COVID-19 restrictions in place. You should review the Chilean government website to check which alert level your ‘comuna’ is in and if there are restrictions that might affect your travel plans. <br>
The government has updated restrictions in Chile and created a new system based on three different ‘alert level phases’: Alert Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. These phases correlate with Low, Medium and High Sanitary impact. Rules regarding entry into and within the country change depending on the current alert level in the comuna (municipality) and country. Chile is currently in Alert Level 1.<br>
Mobility Pass for interregional travel: The Chilean government allows Chileans, foreign residents and foreign visitors who have been vaccinated overseas to register for Chile’s Mobility Pass scheme (‘Pase de Movilidad’).<br>
Non-resident foreign travellers will have to present proof of vaccination together with an identity document. This will be valid as a Mobility Pass for internal flights within Chile. <br>
In order to obtain a Mobility Pass, you must fulfil the eligibility criteria on the Chile Government’s MeVacuno website, where you will find more details on accepted vaccines and the process to apply for the Mobility Pass.<br>
Chilean nationals and foreign residents need to enter the website with their clave unica/Chilean C.I. Foreign visitors can create an account with an email. After registering your vaccines, and once approved, a mobility pass with a QR code will be issued. <br>
A Mobility Pass will be requested by Chilean authorities or travel companies when travelling between regions in trips of more than 200 kilometres. An alternative to this requirement for interregional trips will be a negative PCR test result taken in Chile no more than 48 hours before the interregional trip. This alternative will only apply to people that do not have a Mobility Pass and will not apply to people who have had their Mobility Pass disabled. <br>
*Public places and services: You must wear a facemask inside all enclosed public places and open spaces where you cannot maintain social distancing of at least 1 metre. Maintain social distancing at all times and self-isolate immediately if you suspect you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. <br>
You will be asked to show your Mobility Pass (‘Pase de Movilidad’) to access public places such as bars, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs, dance venues, concerts, casinos, bingo halls and leisure activities, as well as sports venues, amusement and theme parks, museums, and fairs.

 International Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry and transit: You will need a valid visa to enter China. The Chinese Visa Application Centres in London, Manchester and Edinburgh are operating but with limited opening hours. The Application Centre in Belfast remains closed.<br>
The Chinese authorities have suspended all direct flights from the UK. This measure will be subject to review but no date has been announced. Restrictions on travel to China from other countries, and the necessary requirements, may be different. Foreign nationals travelling to China from a third country should follow the directions on the website of the local Chinese Embassy or consulate for requirements from that country. <br>
Eligibility for visas for travel to China remains restricted. At present, visas are issued for: <br>
•        applicants who have obtained an “Invitation Letter” or “Verification Confirmation of Invitation” issued by a provincial foreign affairs office or department of commerce (M or F visa) <br>
•        applicants who have obtained a “Notification Letter of Foreigners Work Permit” (Z visa) <br>
•        applicants intending to visit a family member with a Z, M, or F visa <br>
•        applicants intending to visit a family member who is a Chinese citizen or who holds a Chinese permanent residence permit <br>
•        applicants (including dependents) who qualify for a high-level talent (R) visa <br>
•        applicants who qualify for a C visa<br>
Further details on visa requirements can be found on the Chinese Embassy website.
If you’re issued a visa to travel from your country to China in these circumstances you will need to submit a Health Declaration Certificate to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email.<br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Certificate (HDC) from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of two PCR tests for COVID-19, taken 48 hours before you travel. At least one of the tests must be taken within 24 hours of your departure. The two tests must be conducted in different testing intuitions and you can use any legal testing centre that can provide a PCR test and full report. You will not be able to receive a HDC if you have had COVID within the last 14 days. If you have previously been diagnosed with COVID, you will need to upload two additional negative nucleic acid test reports with an interval of more than 24 hours at least 14 days before the departure date. <a href=""http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/visa/jiankangmaEn/202205/t20220527_10693287.htm"">Additional guidance</a>   on how to obtain a Health Declaration Certificate can be found on the Chinese Embassy website.
A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao.<br>
Health checks on arrival: All international arrivals will be subject to PCR testing on arrival, during and after quarantine. Even asymptomatic carriers will be isolated in a Covid hospital until they return at least three consecutive negative results. There have been some cases of individuals testing intermittently positive for a number of weeks. Travellers with a history of COVID-19 infection should consider leaving a gap between an infection and travel to China. All travellers should take precautions before and during travel to minimise as far as possible the chances of testing positive on arrival.<br>
Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact the Chinese Embassy before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine in a centralised facility for at least 7 days and an additional 3 days at home if you have suitable accommodation. In the event your accommodation is not deemed suitable, all 10 days of quarantine will be in a centralised facility. Policy is region-specific, you should check local requirements before you travel.  At some points of entry, children 14 and over, will be required to quarantine alone, irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID-19. <br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. Whilst we cannot prevent this, if it happens to you or is about to happen, you can call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care. <br>
Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province.
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. <br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        unless directed by the authorities, you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for the duration of your quarantine and/or home isolation. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms.<br>
•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication.  <br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.<br>
After quarantine: Following quarantine, you will need to obtain a green QR health code in order to secure accommodation. In cities with lockdowns, many hotels no longer accept new guests, including those who have recently arrived into China and completed mandatory quarantine. Before arriving into China, you should ensure you have confirmed your accommodation following your mandatory quarantine.<br>
  <br>
  <br> 
Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health kit apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations. Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine and other COVID-19 measures, including PCR tests to enter public buildings, are enforced by local authorities and vary across China, so you should check in advance. <br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory lockdowns in response to fresh outbreaks is high. Such lockdowns may result in disruptions to medical and other basic services, including food delivery. You should ensure you have prepared additional food, water and medical supplies in case you are mandated to isolate at home. <br>
There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice, including requirements for evidence of a negative COVID-19 NAT test within 48 hours of travel from high to medium risk areas. <br>
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19.",20220812,,,

*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year
If you are not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year, you can enter Ecuador. You will need to show evidence of a positive laboratory PCR test (taken more than 14 days and less than a year ago). <br>

COVID-19 vaccination certificates are also mandatory for all passengers over 5 years old for all inter-district, interstate, urban and tourist buses.<br>
Please note that Ecuador’s National Emergency Operations Committee (COE) only makes recommendations, but the power to impose these restrictions rests with local authorities. As a result, you may see some discrepancies between local areas. Municipality authorities will decide whether to enforce the COE’s announcement of 28 April 2022 regarding the optional use of masks in public spaces. Quito municipality has stated they will align to the COE’s resolution on the use of masks, but highly recommend its use in public indoor spaces.

 <br>
 International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You will need a visa with a valid travel document to enter Ethiopia. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Passengers age 12 and over who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than two weeks before the date of entry are required to show evidence of this. Accepted vaccinations are a single dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses for Astra-Zeneca, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Moderna and Pfizer. <br>
Travellers under the age of 12 do not need to show proof of vaccination.
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: If you’re not fully vaccinated, you’ll need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 RT PCR test result issued within the 72 hours (3 days) before departure, or a rapid lateral flow test up to 24 hours before arriving in Ethiopia. A lateral flow test must be certified by a testing centre and not self administered. Pre-departure tests are not required for passengers under the age of 12 or diplomats. You may need to demonstrate you have such a test certificate before boarding your flight.
You should arrange to take a private test. 
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past 90 days: If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 you can enter Ethiopia if you have certificate of recovery from within the last 90 days or evidence of vaccination as above.
Children and young people: Children under 12 are not required to be vaccinated or show evidence of recovery.
*If you’re transiting through Ethiopia: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination.
If you are planning to travel via Ethiopia, you should be aware that restrictions apply. Transit passengers are those with an onward ticket to another destination, who do not formally enter Ethiopia. Transiting passengers are exempt from the current quarantine restrictions for COVID-19. The maximum transit time is 72 hours. <br>
While you don’t need a negative COVID-19 test to transit Addis Ababa, you should ensure that you have the correct tests for your onward journey. Check  the countries you are travelling to. Foreign nationals have previously been tested in transit and had to complete mandatory quarantine in Ethiopia after testing positive for COVID-19.
Passengers transiting for 24 hours or less can remain in the departure lounge of the airport. For transits over 24 hours, you will be taken to a designated transit hotel for the duration of your stay. On arrival in Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, you should report to the transit desk to confirm your hotel details. After health screening and immigration you will then need to present your hotel details and passport to the desk marked “transit shuttle bus” from where you will be taken to the hotel. You will not be able to leave the hotel during your transit. To the extent airline schedules allow, you should therefore minimise the duration of your transit in Addis Ababa. <br>

<br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in France: From Monday 16 May, wearing masks on public transport is no longer compulsory, although some towns and cities may require mask wearing on public transport. You should check local mask rules before you travel. Wearing masks on public transport remains recommended, especially for vulnerable people. <br>
Some travel operators such as airlines may specify types of masks to be worn on board e.g. surgical masks, and may encourage you to take spares for long journeys. Please check with your travel operator before travelling. <br>
There are no internal travel restrictions in France; however, measures may change at short notice either at national or at local level. You should visit the <a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus"">French Government Coronavirus Information page</a> or use the ‘TousAntiCovid’ digital app for further information and to stay up to date on restrictions. <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are mandatory in all health establishments (hospitals, clinics, retirement homes, nursing homes and assisted living, as well as establishments for people with disabilities).<br>
Pass sanitaire (health pass)
The pass sanitaire is currently required to access the following places:<br>
•        Hospitals, clinics, social/medical health care establishments
•        Retirement homes, nursing homes, independent and assisted-living residences <br>
•        Establishments for people with disabilities <br>
You can find more information on requirements and how to 
<a href=""https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-coronavirus/pass-sanitaire"">access the “pass sanitaire” from the French Government</a>.
You can get the pass sanitaire by fulfilling one of the following three criteria: <br>
1.        A vaccination certificate (see details on proof of vaccination below), or <br>
2.        A negative PCR or antigen result from a test taken within the last 24 hours, or <br>
3.        A document (dated more than 11 days ago and less than six months ago) proving you have recently recovered from COVID. <br>
Children under 12 are exempt from ‘pass sanitaire’ requirements.<br>
Proof of vaccination: The French Government recognises vaccination certificates that conform to EU norms. This means: <br>
•        7 days after a third dose of Oxford/AstraZeneca,  Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax for domestic use (to obtain a valid “health pass”), or <br>
•        28 days after a second dose of Johnson & Johnson, or <br>
•        7 days after a second injection for those able to demonstrate they have already been infected (this only applies to those vaccinated in France) for domestic use (to obtain a valid “vaccine pass”) <br>
Since 15 February 2022, anyone aged over 18 years and 1 month needs to have received a booster dose within 4 months of the initial course (or after infection for those vaccinated in France) to be considered fully vaccinated for domestic purposes (i.e. to use the pass sanitaire). If the pass deactivates because you have not received a booster within 4 months of the initial course, you can reactivate it by receiving a booster dose. <br>
France will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
Those vaccinated in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland can also choose to scan and save the QR code into France’s “TousAntiCovid” app. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19 in France and you’re fully vaccinated (including a booster) or if you’ve had COVID-19 in the last 4 months, you must self-isolate for 7 days from the day on which you first develop symptoms, or 7 days from the date of the positive test result. Self-isolation can be reduced to 5 days if you take a negative PCR or antigen test (supervised, not self-administered) on day 5 and you have not displayed any symptoms over the previous 48 hours. These isolation rules also apply to children under the age of 12, regardless of their vaccination status.  Further information is available on the TousAntiCovid application. The French health ministry also operates a dedicated coronavirus helpline on +33 (0)800 130 000.

  <br>
International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You need a visa to enter Ghana. You must <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">complete an online health declaration form</a>, not more than three days before travelling. You will also need to complete a separate health declaration form for children aged 5 to 12. Vaccinated travellers do not need to pay for an on arrival COVID test as part of this health declaration process. The travel certificate you generate will be checked prior to departure and on arrival. <br>
When arriving to Ghana all travellers may:<br>
•        be requested to wear a face-mask at all times at the airport <br>
•        undergo a temperature check. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: All travellers aged 18 years and over are required to provide evidence of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at the point of embarkation and upon arrival into Ghana. The Ghana Health Service defines a fully vaccinated person as someone who has taken the full dose of vaccines approved and registered by the Food and Drugs Authority of Ghana. This is one dose of Johnson and Johnson, or two doses of AstraZeneca (Covishield), Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Sputnik V. <br>
You will need to present your vaccination certificate before boarding and on arrival. Expect this certificate to be checked multiple times before leaving the airport, including on leaving the plane, at the health counter, at immigration, and on leaving the airport. You may choose to carry a hard copy of your certificate with you if you are unsure you will have access to the electronic version during your journey.There is no pre travel or on arrival testing requirement if you are fully vaccinated. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Non-resident: Non-resident unvaccinated travellers will not be granted entry into Ghana. Ground staff at your departure airport will not allow you to travel. <br>
Resident: You will need to take the following steps in addition to completion of the online health declaration form, set out in more detail below: take a pre travel PCR test; load that onto the Trusted Travel Scheme website and generate a Travel Code; pay for an on arrival test; and be subject to either vaccination or mandatory quarantine on arrival. Carrying paper copies of everything will make your journey through the airport more straightforward. <br>
You will be required to present a negative PCR test that was taken not more than 48 hours before the start of your journey, both to the airline before embarkation, and upon arrival. <br>
The test on arrival is an antigen fluorescent immunoassay test. It is conducted before baggage is collected at a cost of $150 per passenger. (ECOWAS citizens pay $50). Payment should be made online, before travel, as part of the pre travel <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">health declaration form</a> process. Airport staff expect to see the proof of payment as well as your <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">travel certificate</a> before allowing you to check-in. Test results are normally ready within one hour. You can check your results <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/result.php"">online</a> while you wait. <br>
All partially vaccinated or unvaccinated travellers must either undergo COVID-19 vaccination at the airport on arrival or be sent to 21 days mandatory quarantine in a Hotel at their own expense. The full list of approved vaccines is <a href=""https://www.gacl.com.gh/updated_guidelines/"">set out here</a>. Either Moderna or Pfizer will be offered to pregnant women. <br>
Ghana is part of the <a href=""https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/"">Trusted Travel Scheme</a>. As soon as you have your negative test result, before travel, you also need to complete the following steps; <br>
1.        <a href=""https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/"">Create an online account</a> with the same email address and mobile telephone number you give your PCR test provider. Log on and select check-in; select your country and Ghana as your departure and destination countries; select lab tests (TT); select the matching lab test from the drop down options; click save; provide your flight and passport details as requested; click save to generate a Travel Code (TC); your TC code is then generated for you to copy or download <br>
2.        If your provider is unable to upload your test certificate on your behalf you should enter your TT or BIOMARS code from your PCR certificate, or upload the certificate yourself. You can do that by selecting at any other lab instead of lab tests (TT) <br>
Your PanaBios account details will also allow you to log on to the UNDP endorsed <a href=""https://www.globalhaven.org/"">Global Haven site</a> to validate your PCR test for travel in the same way. <br>
Quarantine requirements for those testing positive on arrival: All arriving passengers should be prepared to comply with Ghana’s COVID-19 Health Protocols. <br>
Those that test positive for COVID-19 on arrival will be assessed by the Port Health Unit for either quarantine in a Government Health facility or isolation centre. This will be at a cost to passengers. Quarantine and/or medical costs can be expensive so it is important that all passengers arrive with adequate access to financial resources. The isolation will be for a period of 7 days. Passports of those who test positive are likely to be retained by Ghana Immigration Services for the duration of isolation. The quarantine process is managed by Ghana Health Service. <br>
The Government of Ghana also advise that all arrivals should have valid insurance. It is more important than ever to get travel insurance and check it provides sufficient cover. <br>
*Exemptions: Children under 18 will not be tested at the airport upon arrival. Children between 10 and17 who are unvaccinated must submit a negative PCR test prior to embarkation as set out above. Children under 10 are exempt from pre-departure COVID-19 PCR testing and COVID-19 testing at the airport upon arrival. Passengers who arrive under emergency circumstances such as diverted flights will not be required to undergo testing if they do not leave the airport or remain in isolation at a hotel. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Ghana: Transit passengers, except where they will remain in the airport throughout or those who were diverted to Accra for an emergency, will also be subject to mandatory COVID-19 protocols as outlined above. <br>
   <br>
   <br>

Notices of ‘no mask, no entry’ are displayed at vantage points including offices, shops, markets, malls, banks and pharmacies.

  <br>
International Restrictions:<br>
*All travellers: You don’t need a visa to enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories as a tourist. On entry, visitors are granted permission to stay for a period of up to 3 months. <br>
Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you’re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.
It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should contact the Israeli embassy. If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country’s immigration policy or procedures. <br>
At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, and at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have sometimes used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states ‘Palestinian Authority only’ or ‘Judea and Samaria only’. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID. <br>
Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli ‘Territory Actions Co-ordinator’, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years. In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. if you need further information. <br>
Emergency Travel Documents: Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Israel. <br>
Previous Travel to Other Countries: Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the nearest Israeli Embassy. <br>
Customs and Immigration: You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to your country. Damage may occur. <br>
If you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure. <br>
Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers’ personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. <br>
Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin: If you’re a foreign national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you will need a Palestinian passport or travel document in order to leave. If you are a Foreign national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. A number of Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin or foreign nationals married to Palestinians have been refused entry to the country. <br>
Dual nationals: Foreign-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Rafah or Allenby Bridge border crossings into Egypt or Jordan and return via the same route. <br>
Children with Israeli parents (father and/or mother) are considered to be Israeli nationals. The Israeli Ministry of Interior insists that these children enter and leave Israel on an Israeli passport. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Israel. No proof of vaccination is required. <br>

 <br>
 <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
<br>
*All travellers: The Japanese <a href=""https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/bordercontrol.html""> Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a>, and <a href=""https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> websites have further details on the entry requirements for all travellers to Japan (including on <a href=""https://www.hco.mhlw.go.jp/fasttrack/en/"">‘Fast Track’ procedures</a>). Rules may be subject to change at short notice. <br>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic Japan has suspended its visa waiver system and all foreign National (Overseas) who do not already hold a valid re-entry permit must obtain a visa by applying in advance. The visa application process for business study or tourism must be initiated by the sponsor in Japan using the <a href=""https://entry.hco.mhlw.go.jp/"">Entrants, Returnees Follow-up System  </a>

*If you’re transiting through Japan: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
The COVID-19 regulations and requirements outlined above do not apply to passengers who are transiting through one Japanese airport and do not go through immigration. However, transit may be precluded by airport closures, movement between terminals and delays between arriving and departing flights.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Facemasks: The Lithuanian Government lifted the majority of COVID-19 related restrictions on 1 May. Medical facemasks remain mandatory to visit patients in medical facilities. These rules do not apply to children under the age of six, or people with a medical exemption. If you cannot wear facemasks on medical grounds, you are advised to wear face shields if possible. Individual medical facilities have the right to apply requirements for other patients, staff, and visitors. <br>
The Lithuanian Government recommends that people should continue to wear facemasks in other indoor public places and on public transport, although it is no longer mandatory. <br>
*Public places and services: The Lithuanian Government no longer requires individuals to prove their vaccination status in order to access non-essential services. <br>
*COVID-19 tests in Lithuania: As a result of the end of COVID-19-related restrictions on 1 May, Lithuania is changing its COVID-19 management strategy. COVID-19 testing and vaccinations will be carried out in ordinary medical facilities; mobile points will be removed; testing will be limited to people with symptoms at the discretion of the GP; and the need for testing before hospitalisation will be decided by individual medical facilities. <br>
Individuals are no longer able to book COVID-19 tests directly themselves. This will be done by health providers at their discretion. <br>
If you are required to have a test for the purposes of travel, you will need to book your test through a private clinic. A list of private clinics offering PCR and antigen tests is available on the <a href=""https://nvsc.lrv.lt/en/information-on-covid-19/for-those-who-have-been-exposed-to-someone-with-covid-19/private-laboratories-for-testing-for-covid-19"">Lithuanian Ministry of Health website</a>

Not all testing centres in Lithuania offer results in English. If you require your results in English, you should request at the point of booking. English language result certificates are likely to incur additional charges. <br>
*Testing positive for COVID-19 in Lithuania: Self-isolation is no longer mandatory for individuals who test positive for COVID-19. If you have symptoms you are advised not to go to work, school or public places. <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on September 13.2022, there are no longer any requirements for travellers to be fully vaccinated in order to travel to New Zealand. However, some transport providers might have in place certain requirements for passengers to travel with them, so please consult your travel provider’s website for further information. <br>
Eligible travellers entering New Zealand will also be given a pack of rapid antigen tests (RATs) with <a href=""https://covid19.govt.nz/international-travel/travel-to-new-zealand/testing-requirements-after-arriving-in-new-zealand/"">instructions </a> for use, at the airport. The requirement to test on day 0/1 and 5/6 now encouraged rather than required. Please see  <a href=""https://covid19.govt.nz/international-travel/travel-to-new-zealand/when-new-zealand-borders-open/#self-isolation-requirements""> New Zealand Government COVID-19</a> for full details. <br>
You do not need a visa to enter New Zealand as a visitor for up to 6 months, but you will need to get a New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) before you travel. <br>
The NZeTA costs NZD $9 if applying via the dedicated mobile app, or NZD $12 if completed online. You will also need to pay an International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy (IVL) of NZD $35 when you apply. Once issued, the NZeTA is valid for up to two years. The New Zealand immigration authorities recommend that applicants allow up to 72 hours for processing. <br>
On arrival in New Zealand, you will also need to satisfy the Immigration Officer that you meet the criteria for visa-free entry, which includes having an onward ticket and sufficient funds to support you during your stay. You can check the full criteria on the New Zealand Immigration website. New Zealand’s immigration rules are strict, particularly regarding employment. Visitors cannot work in New Zealand. <br>
For more information about visas, visit the <a href=""https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas"">New Zealand Immigration website</a> or contact the nearest <a href=""https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/embassies"">New Zealand High Commission</a>.
*If you’re transiting through New Zealand: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. <br>
If you are planning to transit through New Zealand to another country you must request a NZeTA before you travel. You must ensure you hold the necessary entry documentation to your final destination and the other countries which you will transit through. <br>
In most cases, transit passengers must hold an Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) or transit ETA before travel. These are applied for online. See <a href=""https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta"">Information about NZeTA  </a> for further detail.<br>
 <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in New Zealand: From 13 September 2022, the New Zealand government has lifted most legal restrictions that would impact on travel in New Zealand. However, before you travel domestically within New Zealand, make sure you check the COVID-19 requirements with your transport provider as each company may have different policies. <br>
The New Zealand Government does not currently require people to keep track of their movements to help with contact tracing. However, the New Zealand COVID-19 Tracer app is still available to download for this purpose with many shops and businesses displaying their QR codes for scanning. You can find out more about scanning and contact tracing <a href=https://covid19.govt.nz/testing-and-tracing/"""">here</a>.
Range of measures that can be applied locally or nationally: COVID-19 public health measures and restrictions may be applied at a town, city, territorial local authority, regional or national level. <br>
New Zealand currently has minimal COVID-19 requirements around mask use and only those who test positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate. You can check restrictions and health updates on the <a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus"">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a>.
*If you test positive for COVID-19, you may need to stay where you are until you test negative. You may also need to seek treatment there.

If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly and may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. <br>
*Public places and services: Pakistani authorities have used a range of measures on public activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 including requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination, bans on indoor and outdoor dining, restrictions on commercial activities, educational institutes and gatherings. Restrictions may be lifted or re-imposed based on the levels of COVID-19 in the country. <br>
There are mandatory standard operating procedures which must be followed in public spaces, including the use of face masks, temperature screening and social distancing. Across Pakistan, it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public and not wearing one is punishable by a fine. <br>
There are additional varying measures in force in each province including compulsory self-isolation for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms.

You are considered fully vaccinated if you received the second dose in a 2-dose series or a single dose vaccine more than fourteen (14) days prior to the date and time of departure from your country of origin. Your vaccine must either appear on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) List or Compassionate Special Permit (CSP) issued by the<a href=""https://www.fda.gov.ph/list-of-fda-issued-emergency-use-authorization/"">Philippine Food and Drug Administration</a> or have received Emergency Use Listing by the <a href=""https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/agency/who/"">World Health Organization</a>.

If you are arriving in the Philippines with another type of visa and are fully vaccinated, but are unable to provide acceptable proof of vaccination, you will be required to undergo facility-based quarantine until the release of a negative RT-PCR test taken on the 5th day. You will then be required to undergo home quarantine until the 14th day after your arrival.

 <br> 
  <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: Covid-19 Testing and Q-Code: On arrival in South Korea, you need to submit a questionnaire on your health condition. The South Korean government encourages all arrivals to log this information in the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system </a> prior to travel. Paper-based alternatives can be used instead but may result in a slower arrivals process. <br>
As of September 3, 2022, travellers arriving in South Korea are no longer required to provide a negative pre-departure COVID test certificate. <br>
All arrivals, including children aged 5 and younger, and regardless of nationality and length of stay, are required to take a PCR test within 24 hours of entering South Korea. All foreign short-term travellers are advised to take a PCR test at an Airport Clinic. You can reserve an appointment for a test on arrival at Incheon Airport through the <a href=""https://www.airport.kr/ap_cnt/en/svc/covid19/medical/medical.do"">Airport Clinic’s website</a>. Foreign short-term travellers should pay for a PCR test at the Airport Clinic upon arrival while Korean citizens and long-term visa-holders may visit a local public health centre to take a test for free. Arrivals are encouraged to log the result of their arrival PCR test in the <a href=""https://cov19ent.kdca.go.kr/cpassportal/biz/beffatstmnt/main.do?lang=en"">Quarantine COVID19 Defence (Q-Code) system</a>, even if they did not use the Q-Code system when entering South Korea. If you choose not to log your result in the Q-Code system, you may be contacted by the Korean health authorities and asked for your test result. You must remain in your accommodation or residence until you have received a negative PCR test result. <br>
If your test is positive, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. You will be required to stay at a quarantine centre for 7 days (if you are a short-term visitor) or to isolate at home (if you are a long-term resident and if your accommodation meets certain standards). You will not need to take another PCR test at the end of your quarantine. For more information contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 from inside South Korea (support is available in English).<br>
*Quarantine requirements: There is no quarantine requirement for entry to South Korea, but as noted above you must remain in your accommodation or residence until you have received a negative result on your post-arrival PCR test. <br>
Data collection: Make sure you have with you a mobile telephone with the roaming function enabled, and/or the telephone number of a friend, relative or contact who can update the authorities on your state of health, if required. A hotel telephone number will not be accepted. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for vaccinated individuals. Vaccinated travellers should follow the rules for all travellers.<br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: There are no special provisions for unvaccinated individuals. <br>
If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you have recently recovered from COVID-19, you should bring with you an official note from your doctor detailing when you tested positive, what treatment you received and/or what isolation you observed. If you test positive or inconclusive on arrival, Korean officials will consider this information when deciding how to proceed. Korean health officials have broad discretion in deciding what precautions are required and you may be required to quarantine even if you are no longer testing positive. <br>
Otherwise, there are no special provisions for individuals who have had COVID-19 in the past year. 
  <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: Face masks are compulsory indoors and on public transport. Failure to wear a mask can result in a fine of up to 100,000 Korean Won. <br>
For full details of the current restrictions and requirements you should check the South Korea <a href=""https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030"">Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) </a>and <a href=""http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/"">Ministry of Health and Welfare  </a> websites (English).

*Testing positive for COVID-19: If you think you might have COVID-19 while in South Korea, you should self-isolate immediately and contact the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency on 1339 for guidance (support is available in English). Locations where you can receive a free test are common in most cities. If you are eligible to receive a PCR test, you will usually receive your results via text message within 1-2 days. If you are not eligible to receive a PCR test, you will receive an antigen test which provides results within approximately 30 minutes. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19, you must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. The Korean authorities have made clear that if you have no or mild symptoms you will generally be eligible for quarantine and treatment at home, unless you are unable to sufficiently isolate from others. If the Korean authorities judge it necessary, you will be moved to a quarantine centre or a hospital/treatment centre. There is currently no charge for quarantine centre stays or for medical care in a hospital/treatment centre as long as you have not violated any quarantine measures. Fully vaccinated individuals will generally need to quarantine (whether at home or in a facility) for seven days. Korean health authorities generally have broad discretion to apply the rules as they see fit. You may face additional costs from your travel provider if you have to rearrange your travel. <br>
Anyone displaying symptoms or returning a positive test result for COVID-19 must comply with self-quarantine and treatment instructions issued by the Korean authorities. Failure to do so could result in imprisonment, deportation, the revocation of visas or residence permits and an entry ban, and you may be held liable for the cost of your treatment and for any economic losses incurred by further transmission of the virus. The Ministry of Justice has made clear that this policy applies to foreign residents as well as short-term visitors.

International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry restrictions: Non-Russian nationals must produce a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours before their arrival in Russia. You may enter Russia by air, sea or land via any country. You should check with your airline before you travel to keep up to date with the latest requirements. <br>
Currently there are a limited number of air links and rail routes to Russia due to sanctions. <br>
*All foreign travellers arriving in Russia: <br>
All foreign passengers should complete a travel form prior to arriving in Russia. The forms are usually handed out to passengers by cabin crew on arriving flights. The template is available at the <a href=""https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/upload/%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0%20RUS.docx"">Rospotrebnadzor website</a> (only in Russian).<br>
The following requirements apply regardless of vaccination status. <br>
The Russian government requires all arriving foreign nationals to carry a negative COVID-19 (PCR) test result, dated within 48 hours before arrival in Russia. If a passenger arrives in Russia without a negative PCR test, they should have the test done within 48 hours from their arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative PCR test. Airlines may have different requirements, you should check with them before travelling. <br>
Additional requirements apply to foreigners who enter Russia from the Eurasian Economic Union countries (Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan) and some CIS countries (Azerbaijan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) by air. Passengers arriving from these countries are required to receive a negative PCR COVID-19 test via the “Travelling without COVID-19” app and present the test result on the smartphone upon arrival. This does not apply to transit passengers travelling to Russia through the above countries. Transit passengers are required to present a certificate for a negative PCR test, with the result being within 48 hours before their arrival in Russia and a proof of travel (tickets and/or boarding passes) for the entire route. <br>
You should check the specific COVID-19 test requirements airlines have in place in advance of your flight. Airlines may refuse boarding if their requirements are not met. <br>
Testing/screening on arrival: Passengers arriving by air may be temperature-checked and/or randomly selected for additional PCR testing on arrival. No prior arrangements are required. Passengers should follow guidance of the Russian authorities upon landing. <br>
For passengers travelling out of Russia, express COVID-19 tests can be carried out at some airports. In Moscow, express COVID-19 tests are available in <a href=""https://www.svo.aero/en/covid19/testing/covid-19-testing"">Sheremetyevo</a>
, <a href=""https://www.dme.ru/flight/covid-19/test-info/"">Domodedovo</a>  and <a href=""http://medicine.vnukovo.ru/issledovaniya-covid-19/"">Vnukovo</a> airports. They may need to be booked in advance and pre-paid. In St Petersburg, express COVID tests can be carried out at <a href=""https://pulkovoairport.ru/covid-19-test/"">Pulkovo airport</a>.
A list of certified Russian laboratories is available at the <a href=""https://www.rospotrebnadzor.ru/region/korono_virus/perechen_lab.php"">official website of the Russian state regulator Rospotrebnadzor</a> (only in Russian). <br>
*Quarantine requirements: All foreign travellers arriving in Russia have to present a certificate confirming a negative PCR test result, taken within 48 hours before their time of their arrival. The certificate needs to be in English or Russian. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: The entry requirements for Russia apply regardless of vaccination status. <br>
Proof of vaccination status: You do not need to present proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Russia. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: The entry requirements for Russia apply regardless of vaccination status.
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: The entry requirements for Russia apply regardless of your COVID-19 recovery status. <br>
*Children and young people: Children of all ages need to obtain and present a negative COVID-19 (PCR) test result, dated within 48 hours before arrival in Russia. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Russia:<br>
*Travelling between Russia and Belarus: <br>
By air: Foreign nationals flying to Russia from Belarus or to Belarus from Russia are subject to immigration control. If you’re transiting Russia when flying to/from Belarus, please contact the nearest Russian embassy or consulate to check if a transit visa is needed. <br>
By road: There are no immigration check points on the land border between Russia and Belarus so foreigners (including British nationals) who cross the land border between Russia and Belarus will have no stamps in their passports and will be deemed to have entered illegally. If you’re planning on driving to Russia, you’ll need to take an alternative route through a different country. <br>
By rail: If you’re planning on travelling by rail between the two countries, you should contact your train or tour operator when you make your booking to seek their advice to avoid entering Russia without passing through immigration and thus being deemed to have entered Russia illegally. You should also consider contacting your nearest Russian embassy or consulate for advice on the latest situation for rail travellers. <br>
You should make sure you have all the necessary visas for the duration of your travel.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br> 
*Travel in Russia: The Federal Government has delegated responsibility for introduction or relaxation of restrictions to the regional authorities. Different restrictions may be in force in different regions. You should follow regional advice. Check the latest announcements from local authorities before travelling. These are available in Russian at 
<a href=""https://стопкоронавирус.рф/information/"">https://xn--80aesfpebagmfblc0a.xn--p1ai/information/</a> – click on a specific region on the map for local COVID restrictions. <br>

. For Saint Petersburg, advice can be found on the <a href=""https://www.gov.spb.ru/covid-19/"">City Government’s website</a>.
Following widespread reports of military activity in Ukraine, on 24 February the Russian authorities announced restrictions on domestic flights to a number of airports in southern Russia, with disruption to internal flights to and from Moscow and other cities. Currently Anapa, Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Gelendzhik, Krasnodar, Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov-on-don, Simferopol and Elista are affected. Check the latest information with your airline or travel provider. The Russian aviation authorities have published <a href=""https://favt.gov.ru/novosti-novosti/?id=8944"">information about the affected airports </a> (in Russian). <br>
*Public places and services: Social distancing of 1.5 metres may still be recommended at certain locations. <br>
In some locations QR codes may be required to access venues such as museums, theatres, stadiums, shopping centres or restaurants. QR codes are typically issued to those either vaccinated with a Russian vaccine, recently recovered from COVID-19 or with a recent negative PCR test. Requirements and procedures for obtaining QR codes vary depending on the region. Foreign nationals may not be required to have a QR code if they present a documentary proof of full vaccination by a Russian vaccine. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels in Russia remain open. <br>
*If you test positive for COVID-19 while in Russia, you will be required to self-isolate until you have recovered and tested negative for COVID-19 on a PCR test. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.

International Restrictions: <br>
*All travellers: In general, Foreign citizens do not need a visa to transit or enter Singapore. It’s up to <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/"">Immigration and Checkpoints Authority</a> to decide who can enter Singapore. <br>
All arrivals in Singapore must complete an electronic <a href=""https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/"">SG Arrival Card</a> up to three days before entry into Singapore. This online form requires travel details and a health declaration. It is illegal to submit a false declaration. <br
If you’re arriving from certain countries in Africa and Latin America, 
<a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/yellow-fever-vaccination-certificate""> you may need to show a yellow fever certificate to enter Singapore</a>.
There are other measures in place for foreign crew working on ships, small vessels, or pleasure crafts at one of Singapore’s marinas. See 
<a href=""https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/arriving/overview#crew"">guidelines for air/sea crew and pleasure craft owners</a> . Check with your employer or agent for any specific COVID-19 rules at the marina. <br>
Singapore has strict rules on: <br>
•        wearing masks on public transport and in healthcare settings <br>
•        being fully vaccinated to dine out, attend an event with over 500 people and enter some nightlife venues <br>
•        testing, self-isolation and quarantine, whenever these are required <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 you are required to defer your travel to Singapore until at least 72 hours after you test negative, or, for those who continue to test positive, for at least 7 days for vaccinated people and at least 14 days for unvaccinated people. <br>
Breaking these rules can lead to a lengthy investigation, fines, or a prison sentence.  <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: To enter Singapore you must be fully vaccinated and have digital or physical copies of your vaccination status. If you are not vaccinated, see the entry requirements for unvaccinated people below. <br>
Children aged 12 years and under who are unvaccinated but travelling with fully-vaccinated parents or guardians can enter Singapore. This includes children turning 12 years old in 2022. <br>
If you’re fully vaccinated and you’ve recovered from COVID-19 in the past three months, you may be exempt from taking COVID-19 tests. See the <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart"">ICA</a>  website for complete information. <br>
What happens if you test positive for COVID-19
You’ll need to self-isolate at the hotel or home you’re staying in. What happens next will depend on whether you’re well or unwell. See <a href=""https://ask.gov.sg/agency/moh?topics=I%20am%20a%20traveller%20to%20Singapore"">Ask MOH</a>. Breaking self-isolation or quarantine orders is an offence. <br>
*Proof of vaccination status: You must show proof that you have been fully vaccinated to enter Singapore. <br>
Singapore will accept the proof of COVID-19 vaccination record. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
If you’re on a short-term pass in Singapore, you are asked to 
<a href=""https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/"">download the TraceTogether app</a> or 
<a href=""https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/900007673943-Are-travellers-required-to-use-TraceTogether-TT-during-their-stay-in-Singapore"">buy a TraceTogether token</a> to scan in and out of public venues. <br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Until 29 August if you are not fully vaccinated you cannot enter Singapore unless you are a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident. From 29 August unvaccinated people will be able to enter Singapore for short-term visits but must show a negative pre-departure COVID-19 test result that was conducted or supervised by healthcare professionals, and that was completed within two days before travel. COVID-19 travel insurance of a minimum cover of S$30,000 is also compulsory and proof of insurance must be shown. For details, visit the <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart"">ICA website</a>.
*Children and young people: Children born on or after 1 January 2010 (i.e. aged 12 and below by year of birth) are exempted from COVID-19 border measures. See Singapore’s <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart"">ICA website</a> for full guidelines. <br>
*If you’re transiting through Singapore: Transiting is when you pass through one country on the way to your final destination. Check with your airline if it has approval to transit through Singapore. <br>
Passengers transiting Changi Airport for less than 24 hours and not entering Singapore are not required to have proof of vaccination or tests, and are also not required to complete any entry approval measures. You do not need a visa for an airside transit in Singapore. <br>
More information about transiting through Singapore can be found on the <a href=""https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart/transiting-singapore"">Transiting through Singapore</a>   page of the ICA website. <br>

*Individuals who test positive for the Coronavirus in Suriname before returning to their country will be expected to self-isolate for 10 days, either in a hotel or private accommodation. Individuals may be contacted by the Ministry of Health if they have tested positive for the virus. The Government of Suriname will not provide assistance for people who may need to leave their hotels. Minors (under 18 years) are unlikely to be treated differently to adults.

  <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Thailand: Domestic travel options within Thailand are available but remain subject to disease control measures. If you are taking an internal flight in Thailand, you may be asked to download an app or complete additional travel documentation. <br>
From 23 June, mask wearing is a voluntary practice. However, the Ministry of Public Health continues to recommend that you wear a mask in a crowded or badly ventilated place such as public transportation. You should wear a mask if you have COVID-19 symptoms or you are in a high risk group. Inside public buildings, you will need to wear a mask unless you are by yourself or are doing activities in which a mask cannot be worn.

You may also need to follow other disease control measures.  Some services and facilities in hotels may not be available e.g. leisure facilities. <br>

You will need a visa and letter of invitation (LOI) to enter or travel through Turkmensitan as a visitor. <br>
You should consult the Turkmen Embassy in your country well in advance of your intended travel date. All visa applications made at Turkmen Embassies overseas are referred to Ashgabat for a decision. This can take 20 days or more. There is an accelerated 24 hour service, but a supplementary fee of approximately US$150 will be charged. <br>
You will need a letter of invitation (LOI), certified by the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan, from a private individual or company to support your application. For tourists, these can be obtained from authorised travel agents. A list is available from the embassies in Ashgabat.

If you intend to travel from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan across the Caspian Sea you should be aware that it is not possible to buy a visa on arrival at Baku seaport. Make sure you have a valid visa to enter Azerbaijan if you take the ferry. On arrival, you must pay a US$14 migration fee ($10 fee plus $4 Admin charge). <br>
You must register within three days of arrival with the State Migration Service of Turkmenistan at their office at 57 Azadi Street, Ashgabat. Registration is for the period of the visa and may be carried out on your behalf. If you are not staying in Ashgabat, you should register at the local department of Migration Service instead.

  <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry requirements: Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
All non-exempt foreign nationals, in addition to their health insurance policy, must have: <br>
•        a document confirming receipt of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination with WHO-approved vaccines – which Ukraine lists as Pfizer, AstraZeneca (Vaxzevria, Covishield and SKBio), Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and CoronaVac, or one of: <br>
•        a negative Rapid Antigen Test taken no more than 72 hours before entry, or; <br>
•        a negative PCR test taken no more than 72 hours before entry. <br>
The requirement for proof of vaccination or a negative test does not apply to children under 12. <br>
Non-exempt foreign nationals without proof of vaccination (ie one or both doses) will be required on arrival to install the “Vdoma” app, which monitors self-isolation. The State Border Service will refuse entry to anyone who is unable, or refuses, to install the “Vdoma” app. See the official <a href=""https://www.visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine site  </a> and click “more details” for further information. <br>
During the first 72 hours after arrival (unless travelling from Russia), you can take a PCR or Rapid Antigen test. If you test negative for COVID-19, you will not need to self-isolate. If you do not take a test in those 72 hours, you must begin self-isolating at the address you register on the Vdoma app, for 10 days. You can end self-isolation early if you receive a negative PCR or Rapid Antigen test result. <br>
Unvaccinated travellers (with certain exceptions listed on <a href=""http://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine</a>) who travel from Russia (including for transit through Ukraine) and have spent 7 or more days of the previous 14 days in those countries, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and will not be able to take a test in Ukraine to avoid or reduce self-isolation. <br>
As of 3 December 2021, foreigners without a residence permit or other exemption (see Visit Ukraine for details) who have spent more than 7 of the last 14 days in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique or Malawi, are not permitted to enter Ukraine. Those with a residence permit or exemption may enter, but must undergo a mandatory 14-day self-isolation and will not be able to take a test to reduce the period of self-isolation.
*Exemptions for foreign nationals: According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 25 October 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance, PCR/RAT/express testing or vaccination requirements, and do not have to install the “Vdoma” app.<br>
These categories include foreign nationals who are: <br>
•        recognised as refugees; <br>
•        accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; <br>
•        air, sea, and land transport crews, or; <br>
•        military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. <br>
The full list of exemptions is available on <a href=""https://www.visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine</a> (click “more details” and scroll to the bottom). <br>
Foreign nationals who are permanent residents of Ukraine are exempt from the insurance and PCR/RAT testing requirement, though they must provide a document confirming receipt of one or more doses of a recognised COVID-19 vaccine or install the Vdoma mobile app and self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation is no longer required if you undergo PCR testing or a rapid antigen test within 72 hours of entry and get a negative result; except for permanent residents of Ukraine on arrival from Russia, who are subject to self-isolation for 14 days without the possibility of early termination. <br>
The final decision on a person’s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion.
*Demonstrating your COVID-19 status: Ukraine will accept the proof of COVID-19 recovery and vaccination record and proof of COVID-19 vaccination issued in the Crown Dependencies. Your appointment card from vaccination centres is not designed to be used as proof of vaccination and should not be used to demonstrate your vaccine status. <br>
*Transiting Ukraine: Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide documents confirming their departure from the country within 48 hours and proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. Transiting travellers are exempt from self-isolation, installing the Vdoma application, and undergoing testing in Ukraine. <br>
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. <br>
Further information about visiting Ukraine during the quarantine period can be found at the Ukrainian authorities’ <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/"">Visit Ukraine webpage</a>.
<br>
<br>
Internal restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Ukraine: Although not widely enforced due to the ongoing war, you require a vaccine certificate or negative PCR or express-test taken within 72 hours of travel, if travelling inter-city (by train, bus or plane). <br>
*Quarantine measures: COVID-19 quarantine measures are theoretically in place until 31 August 2022, but have been suspended since the introduction of martial law. Masks are not obligatory, though they remain “recommended” in public places. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotel accommodation remains open under the present COVID-19 quarantine rules, but security and availability are severely affected by the ongoing invasion. Hostels may only open in yellow, orange or red zones if all staff and customers are vaccinated. Hotel restaurant facilities are subject to the same rules as other restaurants, and will likely require a vaccinate certificate or negative Covid test for all customers. When staying in a hotel, you must adhere to the overall rules regarding masks and minimum distancing. If possible, check in online in advance to avoid check-in queues at the hotel. <br>

International Restrictions:  <br>
*All travellers: You will need to get a visa or an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver to enter or transit the USA as a visitor. You should consult the <a href=""https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html"">US State Department website</a> to determine which you will need.<br>
You should be aware that if you have travelled to or have been in Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen on or after 1 March 2011, you are normally not eligible for an ESTA visa waiver and will need to apply for a US visa.<br>
The US Embassy advise that travellers who come under the following categories should not attempt to travel on an ESTA and should instead apply for a visa: those who have been arrested (even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction); those who have a criminal record; those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from the USA; those who have previously overstayed under an ESTA. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: Most fully vaccinated foreign citizens can enter the USA. The US authorities will accept any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These are the AstraZeneca, BIBP/Sinopharm, Covishield, Janssen, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac vaccines. In addition, those who have received the full series of an active (not placebo) COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trials are considered vaccinated. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. Foreign nationals planning to travel to the USA should familiarise themselves with the new requirements on the CDC website before booking any travel.<br>
All current visa holders based in the USA who leave the country and then re-enter will need to follow the vaccine entry requirements unless they have an exception. This includes students on F-1 and M-1 visas and those previously issued with an existing National Interest Exception. <br>
All air passengers to the USA are also required to provide contact information to their airlines before boarding. You should check with your airline before you travel for more details. Effective from Sunday 12 June 2022 at 00:01 ET (5:01 am BST), the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">CDC</a> no longer require pre-departure COVID-19 testing for USA-bound air travellers. <br>
Upon arrival, fully vaccinated travellers:<br>
•        do not have to quarantine<br>
•        are recommended to take a viral test within 3 to 5 days of arrival in the US.<br>
If you have recovered from a documented COVID-19 infection within the past 90 days (regardless of vaccination status):<br>
•        you do not need to get a test 3 to 5 days after travel<br>

You should check the list frequently as it is likely to change, sometimes daily, as rates of COVID-19 transmission increase or decrease.<br>

The <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/proof-of-vaccination.html"">CDC website</a> lists the forms of acceptable proof of COVID-19 status. This also includes the European Union Digital COVID Certificate. Other accepted methods of proof include a printout of a COVID-19 vaccination record or a COVID-19 vaccination certificate issued at national or subnational level or by an authorized vaccine provider. Alternatively, digital photos of a vaccination card or record, a downloaded vaccine record or a vaccination certificate from an official source (e.g. public health agency, government agency, or other authorised vaccine provider), or a mobile phone application without a QR code. All forms of COVID-19 status must have a personal identifier, at a minimum including full name and date of birth, that match the information on a passenger’s passport or other travel documents. It must also include the name of the official source issuing the record and the vaccine manufacturer and date(s) of vaccination.<br>
*If you’re not fully vaccinated: Only those with an exception or US Citizens, US Nationals, and US Lawful Permanent Residents will be able to enter the US unvaccinated. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/noncitizens-US-air-travel.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> and <a href=""https://uk.usembassy.gov/visas/u-s-visa-and-travel-faqs/"">US Embassy websites</a>, which includes a list of exceptions from the vaccination requirements for certain categories of non-citizens and non-immigrants.<br>
*If you’ve had COVID-19 in the past year: If you’re not fully vaccinated but have tested positive for COVID-19 in the last year you still cannot enter the USA unless you meet one of the exceptions detailed on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>.<br>
*Children and young people: Children 17 and under are exempt from the vaccination requirement. For travel, the US definition of a fully vaccinated child is the same as the definition of a fully vaccinated adult. <br>
After arrival in the US, children 17 and under that are not fully vaccinated may be required to attest that they will take a test 3 to 5 days and will self-isolate should any symptoms develop or if they test positive. A parent or other authorized person should attest on behalf of a passenger 17 and under. More details are on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html"">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>.<br>

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in USA: Many airports in the USA have implemented safety measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. You should check the website of the airport you are flying into or transiting to see how these could affect you. <br>
A number of US states no longer mandate the use of masks and face coverings while in public. However, the guidance will vary from state to state and there can often be different rules within different localities in the same state. You should consult the website of the state or city to which you are travelling. Further details are found on the <a href=""https://www.usa.gov/states-and-territories"">USA.GOV  </a> site. Penalties for breaches of regulations will vary between each state and may sometimes vary in different areas in the same state. <br>
Some areas require proof of vaccination in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. Some private venues, including restaurants and concert halls, have made proof of vaccination (or a recent negative COVID-19 test result) a requirement for entry. The precise requirements may vary from venue to venue so you should check on compliancy requirements in advance. <br>
*Accommodation: Hotels will be operating at capacities dictated by local rules and regulations. <br>
*Public places and services: Local regulations on shops, restaurants, bars, beaches and other leisure activities may be following measures designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some areas require proof of vaccination or evidence of a negative COVID-19 test in order to access local amenities. In certain localities, children aged 5 to 17 years may not be exempt from this requirement. <br>
*If you test positive while in the USA, you may be required to isolate in a private area, likely a hotel or a private residence. Isolation requirements will depend on the guidance in the state where you are residing/visiting. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">recommends</a> a minimum isolation period of at least five full days. Any assistance for those required to quarantine will depend on the local authority. The CDC has <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html"">updated guidance  </a> with recommendations for what to do if you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19. You should check the CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html"">travel planner</a> to verify local state guidance.

  <br>
 International Restrictions: <br>
 *All travellers: You don’t need a visa to enter The Occupied Palestinian Territories as a tourist. On entry, visitors are granted permission to stay for a period of up to 3 months. <br>
Visitors entering via Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport are given an entry card instead of an entry stamp in their passport. While this practice is in place at other ports of entry, there have been instances where passports have been stamped for entry purposes. You should keep your entry card with your passport until you leave. This is evidence of your legal entry into Israel and may be required, particularly at any crossing points into the Occupied Palestinian Territories. If you’re refused entry into Israel, your passport may be stamped with an entry stamp and two red lines drawn across it to indicate the refusal.
It is for the Israeli authorities to decide if you can enter Israel. If you have any particular concerns about visas or entry into Israel, you should contact the Israeli embassy. If you work in Israel without the proper permissions, you can be detained and then deported, a process which could take several months. Consular staff will not be able to help you enter Israel or the Occupied Palestinian Territories. They are unable get involved in another country’s immigration policy or procedures. <br>
At the Allenby Bridge crossing with Jordan, and at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, Israeli border officials have sometimes used an entry stamp for certain travellers that states ‘Palestinian Authority only’ or ‘Judea and Samaria only’. Since travellers entering via the Allenby Bridge crossing must pass through Israeli checkpoints and Israeli-controlled territory to reach Jerusalem or Gaza, this restriction effectively limits travellers who receive this stamp. It is not clear how a traveller receiving the stamp at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport can leave the airport without violating the restriction. This stamp has been issued to travellers who have no Palestinian or other Arab ancestry, and who would not seem to have any claim to a Palestinian Authority ID. <br>
Israeli border officials at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport have also at times required certain travellers to sign a form that states that he/she is not allowed to enter territories controlled by the Palestinian Authority unless he/she obtains advance authorisation from the Israeli ‘Territory Actions Co-ordinator’, and that violating this restriction may result in the traveller being deported from Israel and barred from entry for up to 10 years. In March 2017 the Israeli Parliament passed a law which gives authority to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for a boycott. if you need further information. <br>
Emergency Travel Documents: Emergency Travel Documents (ETDs) are not valid for entry into Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories unless the holder is a returning resident. However, ETDs are accepted for airside transit and exit from Israel. <br>
Previous Travel to Other Countries: Evidence of a previous visit to another country in the region like an entry/exit stamp in your passport does not normally prevent entry into Israel, although it may lead to additional questioning at the border. It is for the Israeli authorities to determine the right of entry into Israel, so if you have any particular concerns about previous travel to another country, you should contact the nearest Israeli Embassy. <br>
Customs and Immigration: You should expect lengthy personal questioning and baggage searches by security officials on arrival and departure from Israel. Electrical items, including laptops, may be taken from departing passengers for security inspection and either stored in the aircraft baggage hold, or returned to you in the UK. Damage may occur. <br>
If you arrive with valuable personal items (computers, camcorders etc.) you may be required to pay a deposit that is refundable on or after departure. <br>
Israeli security officials have on occasion requested access to travellers’ personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. <br>
Entering the Occupied Palestinian Territories: Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs), including by sea to Gaza, is controlled by the Israeli authorities. You must produce a passport and immigration slip, to cross between Israel and the OPTs. <br>
You may be detained on arrival and deported if you are intending to enter Gaza without permission. If you’re entering the country for the purpose of working in the OPTs, you may be refused entry. <br>
For more information, contact the nearest Israeli Embassy. <br>
Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin: If you’re a foreign national of Palestinian origin (on the Palestinian Population Register or holding a Palestinian ID number), you will need a Palestinian passport or travel document in order to leave. If you are a Foreign national with a Palestinian name or place of birth but without a Palestinian ID number, you may face problems. A number of Foreign nationals of Palestinian origin married to Palestinians have been refused entry to the country. <br>
Dual nationals: Foreign-Palestinian dual nationals living in the West Bank and Gaza are allowed to travel abroad only via the Rafah or Allenby Bridge border crossings into Egypt or Jordan and return via the same route. <br>
*If you’re fully vaccinated: If you’re fully vaccinated, you can enter Israel/The Occupied Palestinian Territories. No proof of vaccination is required. <br>
All travellers must have a health insurance policy with coverage for the treatment of COVID-19. The insurance policy is mandatory to enter Israel. <br>
You are required to fill out an <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/flights/"">entry statement form</a> within 48 hours before your flight to Israel. <br>
From 20 May 2022 you do not need to present a negative result on a COVID test before boarding a flight or cruise to Israel or before arriving at an Israeli land border crossing. There is no requirement to complete a COVID test or isolate on arrival at any point of entry (airport or land border). <br>
Full guidance on requirements upon arrival is regularly updated online. Check <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/abroad/"">the Ministry of Health</a> pages for full details. Further restrictions may be introduced at short notice. <br>
*Entry via Land Borders: You can find the latest guidance on entering and exiting Israel via the land borders on the <a href=""https://corona.health.gov.il/en/directives/leaving-israel/#sea-and-land"">Israeli Ministry of Health’s website</a>.
Those wishing to enter Jordan from Israel will need to register in advance. You can find more information on the <a href=""https://www.visitjordan.gov.jo/"">Visit Jordan website</a>.
